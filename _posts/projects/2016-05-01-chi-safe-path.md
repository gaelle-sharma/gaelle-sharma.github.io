description: "Chi Safe Path allows anyone with access to the internet to report any hazards on sidewalks or other public walkways directly to the city of Chicago's 311 Services. Additionally, the app allows access directions avoiding reported hazards, making it easier to get from point A to point B without worrying as much about what could be in between."
