<hr><p>Nowadays, more and more folks are paying attention to civic tech, seeing potential at the intersection of civics &amp; all things digital. However, &lsquo;civic tech&rsquo; is tough to define - it can mean different things to different people of different backgrounds. This multiplicity&nbsp;is <em>exciting</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Civic Tech Voices is a collaborative blogging experiment, of sorts, with the goal of amplifying more diverse perspectives &amp; stories in civic tech.</strong></p>
<p>This means that <span>folks who don&rsquo;t already blog &amp;&nbsp;</span>folks in under-represented groups are <em>especially</em>&nbsp;encouraged to contribute!</p>
<p>Have&nbsp;<strong>thoughts</strong>&nbsp;on civics? on access? on the distribution of power in society?<br>Have&nbsp;<strong>stories</strong>&nbsp;of writing FOIA requests? of breaking down bureaucracy? of learning something new?<br>Have&nbsp;<strong>expertise</strong>&nbsp;in community organizing? in design? in wrangling data?</p>
<p>Shoot me an email (<a href="mailto:cathyd125@gmail.com">cathyd125@gmail.com</a>) &amp; let&rsquo;s share what you have to say!</p>
