April 12th, 2016 marked our 200th Chi Hack Night! 

From our humble beginnings on [March 22nd, 2012](http://chihacknight.org/events/2012/03/22/the-first-hack-night.html) as 4 nerds sitting around a table eating macaroni, to this week with 130 people from across the city from all manner of backgrounds, skillsets and neighborhoods, we have come a long, long way.

For those of you who have ever attended Chi Hack Night, I thank you for participating. For everyone else reading this, come join us next Tuesday!

Here’s what happened at [Chi Hack Night 200](/events/2016/04/12/200th-event-celebration.html):

## Lightning talks

To celebrate this day, we forgoed from our typical presentation, and instead heard lightning talks from 9 members of Chi Hack Night about what they’ve done at or learned from our group. 

Thanks to sponsorship from Microsoft and the skilled team Scrappers Film Group, we recorded all of them.

### My Building Doesn't Recycle: The Odyssey by [Claire Micklin](https://twitter.com/clairemicklin/)

After launching in February 2015, the app quickly gained media exposure and amassed thousands of resident reports of buildings that do not offer recycling services. 

Now it's time to build on the momentum by extending the app's capacity as an advocacy tool and encouraging further involvement from both building residents and policymakers.

## Blog posts

We also [invited folks](http://localhost:4000/blog/2016/03/25/chi-hack-night-200-call-for-speakers-and-writers.html) to share their Chi Hack Night stories, projects, learnings and congratulations in written form.

**[Congratulations from Cook County Government!](http://chihacknight.org/blog/2016/04/08/200-celebration-congratulations-from-cook-county-government.html)** by Simona Rollinson<br />
Simona Rollinson, Cook County’s Chief Information Officer, offers her congratulations to Chi Hack Night and the broader civic tech ecosystem in Cook County. In addition to providing data and information, she hopes to strengthen the fabric of this community. A strong civic tech community is a public asset.

**[Why I Come to Chi Hack Night](http://chihacknight.org/blog/2016/04/09/200-celebration-why-i-come-to-chi-hack-night.html)** by Emily Drevets<br />
I don’t code or design or project manage or map. I am a writer. And an improviser. And sometimes a marketer. And I read a lot of books. Despite that, I have felt so welcome. More importantly, I’ve realized how every problem is interdisciplinary and we need everyone on board—everyone from all backgrounds— to solve them.

**[Becoming a Runner-Up in a Hackathon (without writing a single line of code)](http://chihacknight.org/blog/2016/04/10/200-celebration-becoming-a-runner-up-in-a-hackathon-without-writing-a-single-line-of-code.html)** by Audrey Henderson<br />
It was September 2012, and I was reading a description for the Reinventing Chicago event at CNT (Center for Neighborhood Technology) the following month. The cost was $100, which isn’t a huge amount of money, but not exactly pocket change, at least not for me. But just as I was about to enter my payment information, I noticed that hackathon participants could attend for free. Even though I had no idea what a hackathon was, I figured, it was a weekend. How bad could it be?

**[Why I Attend Chicago Hack Night Events](http://chihacknight.org/blog/2016/04/11/200-celebration-why-i-attend-chicago-hack-night-events.html)** by Daniel Bassill<br />
I’ve been attending Chicago Hack Night events for at least 2 years and I’m writing this article to help celebrate their 200th weekly gathering. This image is from May 29, 2016, where the Heartland Alliance presented information. You can see me in the middle, sitting by the wall. That’s my usual spot. Helps me see better.

**[A place to learn and grow civic tech leadership](http://chihacknight.org/blog/2016/04/12/200-celebration-a-place-to-learn-and-grow-civic-tech-leadership.html)** by Christopher Whitaker<br />
In both his State of the Union and his remarks at #SXSW, Chicagoan and President Barack Obama stated that the most important office in a democracy was that of the Office of the Citizen. At Chi Hack Night, we’re privileged to be part of an active movement of people getting engaged in their communities through the use of technology.

## Chi Hack Night Cookies!

It all started with a Tweet by Steven Vance to Ted Whalen. Ted had written a [blog post about how the official Chicago star is supposed to look like](http://introvert.net/blog/2004/04/17/what-is-the-deal-with-the-stars-on-the-chicago-flag/). Knowing this, who better to help with making a proper Chi Hack Night star-shaped cake?

Little did we know, Ted’s wife Donna was a pastry chef.

<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<br />

We got to talking with Donna about a cake, and quickly decided that cookies would be much easier, logistically. So we agreed to pay her for the materials to make 200 star-shaped cookies, each one numbered 1-200 for every event we’ve had.

Here's how they turned out:

At Chi Hack Night 200, we invited people take a cookie to look up the event it corresponded to. The results were amazing.

Donna also made a big 200 cookie, and of course Christopher and I ate it.
