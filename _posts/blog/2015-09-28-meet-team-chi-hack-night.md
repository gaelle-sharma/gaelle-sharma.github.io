**Why did you join Chi Hack Night?**

I joined hack night because I believe in making an ongoing commitment to gather with people who care deeply about making a local impact. I also value that a space exists where people can gather and contribute expertise in data science, computer programming, and other superpowers.

**What are you presenting at the Summit?**

I'm presenting on [using human centered design to improve social service delivery](https://www.codeforamerica.org/summit/schedule/#breakout_138).

**Who are you interested in meeting?**

I'm really excited to connect with 18F about Privacy and Civic Technology Projects. I'm also thrilled to meet folks at Gov.UK because their screening tools are first rate in the industry.

**What would you like to brag about?**

I'm also excited to announce that their [mRelief](http://mrelief.com) tool which helps program providers customize screeners for their community has gone into Private Beta. They encourage thought leaders in civic technology to request an invite at [beta.mrelief.com](http://beta.mrelief.com).

**Who are you interested in meeting?**

Folks who dig information design, folks who are working on something playful/creative, and folks who want to reflect on civic tech failures.
