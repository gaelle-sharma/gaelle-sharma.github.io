With the initial success of our [open data pledge for Cook County State's Attorney](/blog/2016/02/12/chi-hack-nights-open-data-pledge-for-cook-county-states-attorney.html), Chi Hack Night is turning our attention to another important county race. We're inviting every candidate for Cook County Clerk of the Circuit Court to sign a pledge to, if elected, commit their office to publish open data.

### What does the Clerk of the Circuit Court do?

The Clerk of the Circuit Court is the official keeper of records for the [Circuit Court of Cook County](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_Court_of_Cook_County), the second largest court system in the United States. The court manages over 2.4 million cases every year. The Clerk’s office is responsible for managing an [annual operating budget of $96 million](http://lookatcook.com/#!/?year=2015&fund=&controlOfficer=Clerk+of+the+Circuit+Court) and has a workforce of over 1,800 employees. Dorothy Brown is the current officeholder.

Records maintained by the Clerk are not subject to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). Although the court implemented an electronic filing system several years ago, their [open records policy](http://www.cookcountyclerkofcourt.org/gifs/PUBLICACCESS.pdf) only covers records in hard copy paper format and all records requests must be filed in person or by fax. 

[Modernization of the court system](https://www.civicfed.org/civic-federation/whycareaboutcookcounty) remains an ongoing issue. Sometimes critical court papers [have gone missing](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/24/cook-county-clerk-office_n_4156061.html). A modern, transparent open data policy would contribute to the push for a modern court system with [better communication, fewer errors, and lower costs](http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-10-04/news/ct-perspec-1004-zorn-20131004_1_justice-system-writ-branch-court).
