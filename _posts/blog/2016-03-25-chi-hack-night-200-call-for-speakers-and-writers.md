**April 12, 2016 will mark the 200th episode of Chi Hack Night.**

What started as four lonely civic hackers sitting in the Webitects office eating mac & cheese has turned into a fully fledged community of thousands of civic hackers, designers, researchers, journalists, activists, policy wonks, developers and curious citizens. It is truly amazing.

To celebrate this day, we want to hear from you, the members of Chi Hack Night, about what you’ve done with or learned from this group. 

You can participate in two ways:

### <i class='fa fa-bolt'></i> Lightning talks

Instead of a regular presentation, we’re doing lightning talks for Chi Hack Night #200!

Do you have an interesting or funny story to tell about Chi Hack Night? Want to show off that awesome civic project you’ve been working on? Now’s your chance to tell it to the world! 

Talks must be 2 minutes or less and slides are mandatory. [Here's a great example of a short talk by Derek Sivers at TEDIndia](http://www.ted.com/talks/derek_sivers_weird_or_just_different).

Between five and ten proposed talks will be picked to present at Chi Hack Night #200 for fame and glory!

[Submit your lightning talk here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1dQLfSn25lcPFU8MVeoauMoHklDnkWAcqzSnFbOw8m_E/viewform) by Thursday, April 7th.

### <i class='fa fa-pencil'></i> Blog posts

Feeling a bit too nervous to present to a big audience? We still want to hear from you! 

Share your Chi Hack Night story in written form by submitting it to our [blog](http://chihacknight.org/blog/). Posts can be as short or long as you want, and we especially want to hear from new folks who haven’t contributed before. The posts will be published and highlighted at Chi Hack Night #200.

[Submit your blog post here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1p1Ml3rFSMYAgyU7Ue61_N-Gyx2VccuUrKizSntwLNu0/viewform) by Thursday, April 7th.
