<h2><span>New in 2014</span></h2>
<p><strong>Open Gov Hack Night Leadership Council</strong></p>
<p>Back in June one of our beloved organizers, <a href="https://twitter.com/jpvelez">Juan-Pablo Velez</a>, moved away to some place called New York City (miss you JPV!). Concerned with the longevity of our event, I decided to ask the community for help with organizing. Would anyone be interested in stepping up their involvement with the hack night? Turns out the answer was a BIG FAT YES. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q59-f1tEv2mep_GABc5XWy2X_5KA_RTWFm1R75tlAuw/edit#heading=h.sx84es15ov5s">16 people showed up to that meeting</a>. The first Open Gov Hack Night Leadership Council was born!</p>
<p><span><img alt="image" height="468px;" src="/images/blog/2015-01-06-open-gov-hack-night-2014-year-in-review/img3.jpg" width="624px;"></span></p>
<p><em><a href="https://twitter.com/stevevance/status/477211027545669635">@stevevance</a>: &ldquo;Discussing the future of<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/chihacknight?src=hash"> #chihacknight</a> on Tuesday. Testing something new on Tuesday w/knowledge expert groups&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><span>Since then, we&rsquo;ve held regular Leadership Council meetings every 4 weeks. They are free for anyone to attend who is interested in being involved in running the Open Gov Hack Night, suggesting new initiatives, and providing feedback. It has led to a much more robust, thoughtful, and productive community. In fact, everything else I&rsquo;m about to list came out of this group. That&rsquo;s democracy for ya!</span></p>
<p><strong>Breakout groups and topic facilitators</strong></p>
<p><span>The first idea out of our Leadership Council was to try organizing working groups based on particular topics. Because the hack night averages anywhere between 50-80 people every week, with a good 30% being there for the first time, we&rsquo;ve had trouble onboarding people to projects. Christopher Whitaker&rsquo;s </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_on0kXZ07M"><span>Civic Hacking 101</span></a><span> session helped, but there was often a gap between that and diving in to a project.</span></p>
<p><span>Elnaz Moshfeghian suggested that if there was a core group of people that got together to talk about and work on education-related projects, she&rsquo;d be there every week. The seed was planted for dedicated people to act as topic facilitators and run their own working groups on the topic of their choice. Scott Beslow started the environment group. Steven Vance started the transportation group. The rest is history.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://chihacknight.org/breakouts.html"><span>Breakout groups</span></a><span> are now a regular part of the Open Gov Hack Night structure. We have 8 permanent groups led by 13 topic facilitators, and anyone is welcome to start their own.</span></p>

<p><strong>GitHub joins on as a recurring sponsor</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/"><span>GitHub</span></a><span>, after sponsoring a few one-off events, has joined </span><a href="http://datamade.us/"><span>DataMade</span></a><span>, </span><a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/"><span>Code for America</span></a><span> and </span><a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/"><span>ThoughtWorks</span></a><span> in being a recurring sponsor for the hack night (meaning they buy the pizza).</span></p>
<p><span>We love GitHub, and use it to host the code (and sometimes the </span><a href="https://pages.github.com/"><span>websites</span></a><span>) for our open source civic tech projects. Their </span><a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/"><span>API</span></a><span> also powers our open source </span><a href="http://chihacknight.org/projects.html"><span>civic projects directory</span></a><span>, which has since been </span><a href="https://github.com/codeforamerica/cfapi"><span>forked</span></a><span> by Code for America for their </span><a href="http://codeforamerica.org/api/"><span>Civic Tech Movement API</span></a><span>. Turns out, GitHub loves us back!</span></p>
<p><strong>Code of Conduct</strong></p>
<p><span>As our community has grown, we want to make sure our events create a fun, safe, respectful, inclusive and productive space for everyone who wants to participate.</span></p>
<p><span>In December, we drafted a </span><a href="http://chihacknight.org/code-of-conduct.html"><span>Code of Conduct</span></a><span> for our events. It features 10 expectations of our community, as well as an Anti-Harassment Policy. It was written collaboratively by members of the Open Gov Hack Night community and adapted from the</span><a href="https://github.com/codeforamerica/codeofconduct"><span> </span><span>Code for America Code of Conduct</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><strong>Moving to Braintree</strong></p>
<p><span>Starting on January 13, 2015 the Open Gov Hack Night will be hosted at the</span><a href="https://www.braintreepayments.com/"><span> </span><span>Braintree</span></a><span> office on the </span><span>8th floor of the Merchandise mart</span><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>Our event has</span><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/91210421@N03/14635938643/"><span> </span><span>long outgrown</span></a><span> our space at</span><a href="http://1871.com/"><span> </span><span>1871</span></a><span>, and we&rsquo;re excited to use Braintree&rsquo;s atrium and</span><a href="https://scontent-a-ord.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xfa1/v/t1.0-9/10624866_844167315627614_4575618497586207414_n.jpg?oh=b4e5d218a9996f41edd2ae2cf1c04f62&amp;oe=5507C84D"><span> </span><span>meeting rooms</span></a><span> for even more civic hacking!</span></p>
<p><span>A huge thanks to 1871 for hosting us for two and a half years, and another huge thanks to Randy Baxley for making the connection!</span></p>
