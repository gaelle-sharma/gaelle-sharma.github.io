The Open Gov Hack Night is now **Chi Hack Night**! 

I’m happy to announce the new name and logo for our event.

Since we started 3 years and 155 events ago, our event has grown into a community all its own. We emerged out of the [Open Government movement](http://radar.oreilly.com/2011/08/chicago-data-apps-open-government.html) here in Chicago, and have become something much more. 

We’re not just about Open Gov anymore. We’re about *Chicago.*

**And we have a new website, too!**

Along with this new branding and identity, designed by my lovely and talented wife [Aya O’Connor](https://twitter.com/ayaOconnor), comes a re-designed and re-organized website, now located at [chihacknight.org](http://chihacknight.org)

Here’s a few highlights:

* [Events](http://chihacknight.org/events/index.html) - Browse the full list of all 155 events we’ve hosted at the Chi Hack Night, including speakers, agendas, videos (thanks to Christopher Whitaker and Smart Chicago), and photos.

* [Breakout groups](http://chihacknight.org/breakouts.html) - See our ever growing list of Breakout groups and their topic facilitators, including pictures of their beautiful faces.

* [Community](http://chihacknight.org/community.html) - We’ve collected all our resources for [online groups](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/chihacknight), [open source projects](http://chihacknight.org/open-source-projects.html), [data sources](http://chihacknight.org/data-resources.html), [project contributors](http://chihacknight.org/open-source-people.html) and other civic technology events all in one place.

* [Leadership Council](http://chihacknight.org/leadership-council.html) - See every Leadership Council meeting we’ve held along with meeting notes and keep tabs on when the next one is happening.

* [Blog](http://chihacknight.org/blog/index.html) - We’ve merged in [Civic Tech Voices](http://civictechvoices.tumblr.com/), a community blog Cathy Deng set up for all members of the hack night to contribute to. We welcome anyone to [contribute](http://chihacknight.org/blog/index.html)!

As with all of our projects, we’re constantly looking to make the Chi Hack Night website better and more informative for everyone. [Pull Requests are always welcome](https://github.com/open-city/chihacknight.org)!
