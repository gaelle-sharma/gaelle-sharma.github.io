[Tom Schenk, Jr](https://twitter.com/ChicagoCDO) and [Daniel X. O'Neil](https://twitter.com/danxoneil) will debut a new project by the City of Chicago called **OpenGrid** &mdash; an open-source, next generation version of [WindyGrid](http://datasmart.ash.harvard.edu/news/article/chicagos-windygrid-taking-situational-awareness-to-a-new-level-259) &mdash; that will allow the public to navigate Chicago's open data in a more intuitive interface.

Data portals organize data by individual datasets, making it difficult to combine data and see what is happening in your neighborhood. OpenGrid is a public website using data from the City of Chicago Data Portal &mdash; via the [Plenar.io](http://plenar.io) project &mdash; to let users search for events happening around them in user-defined areas or based on the user's location.
