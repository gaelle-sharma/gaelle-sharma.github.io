[Cook County](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Cook_County,_Illinois), the second most populous County in U.S., is composed of [65 agencies](http://www.cookcountyil.gov/agencies/), 11 elected officials, a 17 member [Board of Commissioners](http://www.cookcountyil.gov/board-of-commissioners/) and the [County Board President](http://www.cookcountyil.gov/office-of-the-president/). 

As such, they have a lot of data, and they're working to open up more of it to the public.
