This Tuesday marks the 1 year anniversary of the hack night! What started off as 4 nerds sitting around a table has ballooned to 40 nerds sitting around a table - pretty mind blowing.

It's been amazing to see Chicago's open data community grow - not a week goes by that Derek and I don't hear about some exciting scheme or connection hatched at the hack night.

To celebrate, we're inviting a few friends from the City of Chicago, the City of Philadelphia, and LISC Chicago to have a conversation about the role of residents in civic hacking.

There's a big urban planning conference in town, so civic tech folks from Open Plans, Code for America, and others will be in attendance. (They're throwing a civic tech + planning happy hour on Monday, 6:30pm at Monk's.)
