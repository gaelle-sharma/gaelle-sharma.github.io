We’re starting 2016 off with a bang!

Since 2011, the City of Chicago has published all [current employee names, salaries positions & titles](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Administration-Finance/Current-Employee-Names-Salaries-and-Position-Title/xzkq-xp2w) on the data portal. With over half a million views, it’s the most popular dataset the City has ever published. While this data gives the public valuable insight into how Chicago’s tax dollars are spent, it only gives a partial picture when it comes to how much city employees actually earn.

Through a Freedom of Information Act request, the Chicago Sun-Times was able to get the data to tell the full story, and in November 2015, [published an investigation](http://chicago.suntimes.com/news/7/71/1072015/city-haul-3-of-10-chicago-city-workers-make-100000-a-year) looking at all of the additional ways City of Chicago workers are compensated.

Sun-Times reporters [Chris Fusco](https://twitter.com/FuscoChris) and [Tim Novak](https://twitter.com/tnovaksuntimes) will walk us through the process of obtaining and analyzing this information (which they have [since made publicly available](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YB5JHcweKuhPUSmEyCEI29j2df8RBM5qOsfc3J75-hU/pubhtml)) and some of the more interesting findings within it.
