Each summer, Chicago Public Schools (CPS) comes up with next-year's budget for each school, but this year is different. With ballooning pension obligations, the country's fourth largest school district is [in crisis](http://www.chicagotribune.com/cps-budget-history-htmlstory.html).

To help parents and students dissect the budget crisis and know what the specific impacts would be on his/her school, [Lingwei Cheng](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lingweicheng) and [Patricia Gomes](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/patr%C3%ADcia-gomes/18/b16/b46) from the [Northwestern University Knight Lab](http://knightlab.northwestern.edu/) built **[Your CPS](http://nuknightlab.github.io/cpsbudget/)**, a data-driven dynamic article that delivers personalized and interactive content about every CPS school.
