Instead of a presentation, we want to give everyone in the community a chance to voice their opinion.

We will break out into groups and provide feedback on the following topics:

* What do you like about Chi Hack Night?
* What would you like to learn from this community? 
* What kinds of presentations should would you like to see?
* What could we do differently or better with this community?

Afterwards, we’ll read out the different ideas from each category and then discuss implementing them at …

#### Leadership Council #17

We will have our **17th** [Chi Hack Night Leadership Council](http://chihacknight.org/leadership-council.html) at after the community feedback session. Anyone is welcome to join! 

We'll record everything on the [Leadership Council agenda and notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mlVH4e17v3tBMW5WCrMejKjGr5TPyVrVvpiungpuuQ8/edit#).
