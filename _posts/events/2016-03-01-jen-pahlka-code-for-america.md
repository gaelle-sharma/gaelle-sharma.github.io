Over the past few years, the civic technology movement has spread to hundreds of cities around the world. Much of that is thanks to one organization: Code for America.

[Code for America](http://www.codeforamerica.org/) is San Francisco-based non-profit founded in 2009 to address the widening gap between the public and private sectors in their effective use of technology and design. With their [fellowship](http://www.codeforamerica.org/governments/fellowship/) and [brigade](http://www.codeforamerica.org/brigade/) programs, Code for America has become an anchor for the civic technology movement in the United States and around the world.

[Jen Pahlka](http://twitter.com/pahlkadot), Founder and Executive Director of Code for America, will share a bit about the challenges the [2016 fellowship teams are tackling](http://www.codeforamerica.org/governments/2016-announcement/) and what they are learning about in the issues of economic development, criminal justice, and human services.
