[How’s Business](http://howsbusinesschicago.org/) is an app being developed by [Open City](http://opencityapps.org/) that shows how the local economy. It looks at four indicators: new business licenses, construction permits, unemployment and foreclosures. 

The licenses and permits are from city’s data portal. Open City aggregated them by month, did a seasonal adjustment, visualized the data with a line chart. The unemployment and foreclosure numbers are released quarterly. 

The site’s about page explains the metrics, why they chose them, and the underlying economic concepts in plain terms.
