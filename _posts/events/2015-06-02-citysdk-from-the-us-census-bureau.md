[Jeff Meisel](https://twitter.com/Jeff_Meisel), Presidential Innovation Fellow at the [US Census Bureau](http://www.census.gov) and [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov/) will present [CitySDK](http://uscensusbureau.github.io/citysdk/), a toolbox for civic innovators to connect local and national public data.

The US Census Bureau has learned a lot since releasing it's [public API](http://www.census.gov/developers/) a few years ago on how to better serve data users. CitySDK represents the next step forward: an open-source, modular and community driven framework with a focus on real-world use cases.
