**Feb 24, 2015** is [Chicago's Municipal Election](http://www.chicagoelections.com/en/offices-on-the-ballots.html)! Chicagoans will vote for their next Mayor, City Clerk, City Treasurer and Alderman in each of Chicago's 50 Wards.

We'll skip the presentation for this week - just come to build, share, and learn about civic tech (and watch the returns)!
