The landscape has been rapidly evolving in Chicago City Hall in recent months, with the City Council taking up key legislation on everything from [rideshare regulation](https://www.dnainfo.com/chicago/20160622/downtown/weakened-uber-lyft-ordinance-approved-by-flustered-aldermen) to [AirBnb](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/politics/ct-chicago-city-council-airbnb-rules-met-20160622-story.html) to [police reform](http://www.chicagojustice.org/blog/chicago-police-board-reforms-pass-city-council). 

Communications strategist [Joanna Klonsky](http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/political-flack/BestOf?oid=18028521) is there for it all as communications consultant/spokesperson to many of the aldermen--most notably, the 11-member [Chicago City Council Progressive Reform Caucus](http://www.chicagoprogressivecaucus.com/). 

Joanna will talk about how the changing environment has created new opportunities to make progress in City Hall, and how she works with media to help advance the necessary narratives to make it happen.
