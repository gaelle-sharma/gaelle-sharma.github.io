Have you ever wondered what data schools actually collect, how teachers, principals, and bureaucrats actually use it to make decisions in schools - and why?

[Andrew Martin](https://twitter.com/moneywithwings) from [KIPP New Jersey](http://kippnj.org/) and our long-lost Chi Hack Night co-founder [Juan-Pablo Velez](https://twitter.com/jpvelez) will give an opinionated overview of how some American schools actually do data in 2015. 

They'll also touch on the promise, perils, and letdowns of data-driven education.
