[Zachary Damato](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/zachary-damato/7/7a0/680), from [The Naru Project](http://thenaruproject.org/) will talk about their non-for-profit that focuses on incorporating artificial wetlands into our city's river systems.

The Naru Project's goal is to leverage these wetlands to increase the rehabilitation of aquatic ecosystems, beautify the city landscape and serve as learning hub for everyone in Chicago. 

They will share their research and experience in setting up an artificial wetland in the North Branch of the Chicago River near the [Whole Foods on North Avenue](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Whole+Foods+Market/@41.908693,-87.652927,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0xacf65fe73a7584c2!6m1!1e1).
