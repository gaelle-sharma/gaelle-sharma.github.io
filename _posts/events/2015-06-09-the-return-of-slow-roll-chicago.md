[Slow Roll Chicago](http://www.slowrollchicago.org/) and the Chi Hack Night Transportation breakout group ([previously](http://chihacknight.org/events/2015/01/27/slow-roll-chicago.html)) are ready to present their findings. 

[Olatunji Oboi Reed](https://twitter.com/theycallmeoboi), [Sonju Walker](https://twitter.com/sonjuw), Derek Burk, [Mary Kuhn](https://twitter.com/kuhnbaya) and [Eric Sherman](https://twitter.com/EricShermanCHI) will present their app, the [Bicycle Equity Data Project](http://www.stevevance.net/slowrollchicago/), which uses data to tell the story of inequity in the City of Chicago’s changing approaches to distributing bike infrastructure. 

They will make the case for creating an equitable, diverse, and inclusive bicycle culture for all Chicagoans as a tool for social change.
