Workplace monitoring, just-in-time scheduling and other technologies are [making life more difficult](http://news.medill.northwestern.edu/chicago/hourvoice-workers-rights-smartphone-app-to-launch-in-chicago/) for low-wage workers. [HourVoice](http://hourvoice.com/) attempts to counteract this and other negative trends through crowdsourced transparency, rights education and data analysis. It should create opportunities for labor unions, plaintiff attorneys and enforcement agencies.

[Don Chartier](https://twitter.com/donchartier) from HourVoice and [Ryan Fischer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryanmfischer) from 20spokes development agency will discuss the motivations, aspirations and implementation of the HourVoice Worker App, plus their plans for HourVoice's analytics capability.
