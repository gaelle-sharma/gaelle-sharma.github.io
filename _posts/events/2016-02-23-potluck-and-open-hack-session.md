No presentation this week. Instead, we're going to have another civic hacking potluck! If you'd like to bring drinks, snacks or desserts, [fill out your name and what you're bringing here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HnuXSSqujGn6FGiIXrJdFZ1RfZmJeHJo8KW__ymOBHQ/edit#gid=0)! We'll provide the usual empanadas too.

While we eat, we'll build, share, and learn about civic tech!

**Note:** this event was originally scheduled to be about the [Chi Hack Night's Open Data Pledge for Cook County Stateâ€™s Attorney](/blog/2016/02/12/chi-hack-nights-open-data-pledge-for-cook-county-states-attorney.html), but unfortunately not enough candidates were able to attend. Stay tuned for updates on this and our pledge for [Cook County Clerk of the Circuit Court](/blog/2016/02/16/chi-hack-nights-open-data-pledge-for-cook-county-clerk-of-the-circuit-court.html)!

#### Leadership Council #21

We will have our **21st** [Chi Hack Night Leadership Council](http://chihacknight.org/leadership-council.html) at **8pm** after the group breakouts get started. This meeting is for discussing new ideas and ways to make the hack night better. Anyone is welcome to join! 

If you'd like to bring up a topic, add it to the [Leadership Council agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/117RqcXODfx3eSz-uOWUQ2C73Q4ILnoUdF_V646EL0Mw/edit#).
