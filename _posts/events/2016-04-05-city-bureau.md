[City Bureau](http://citybureau.org/) is a new neighborhood newsroom and journalism training lab based on the South and West sides of Chicago. 

Built on partnerships with youth media organizations, media outlets, community groups and civic foundations, City Bureau trains high school and early career reporters to report on the city's [most pressing issues](http://www.niemanlab.org/2016/01/working-with-young-reporters-city-bureau-is-telling-the-story-of-police-misconduct-in-chicago/).

Now in its second 4-month cycle, City Bureau is continuing coverage on issues of policing and the criminal justice system—including a [recent investigation into Chicago Fraternal Order of Police](http://citybureau.org/briefs/how-chicagos-fraternal-order-of-propaganda-shapes-the-story-of-fatal-police-shootings/)—and has hosted 5 public Town Halls across the South and West sides of the city.

City Bureau's editorial and education directors [Darryl Holliday](https://twitter.com/d_holli) and [Andrea Hart](https://twitter.com/lenifaye) will explore how the group uses data, traditional reporting and a unique collaborative approach in its investigations and civics-based community outreach.
