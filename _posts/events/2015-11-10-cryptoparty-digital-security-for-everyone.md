Let's talk data security! As builders and users of technology, it's important for the Chi Hack Night community to understand the methods in which we can secure our data, and that of our users.

[Jennifer Helsby](https://twitter.com/redshiftzero) from [Cryptoparty Chicago](https://twitter.com/CryptopartyChi) will talk about her work in hosting Cryptoparties - free events to teach people activists, lawyers, journalists, and everyday people how to use privacy tools to secure their data.

Jennifer will talk about why understanding digital security is so important, what goes on at a digital security training, and where to begin when thinking about privacy issues.
