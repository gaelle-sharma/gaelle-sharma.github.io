Elnaz Moshfeghian will give an overview of [Open Source Licenses](http://opensource.org/licenses) and give some tips on picking the right one for your project.

Also, Juan-Pablo and I will share a few interesting stories from this year's Transparency Camp put on by our friends, the [Sunlight Foundation](http://sunlightfoundation.com/).
