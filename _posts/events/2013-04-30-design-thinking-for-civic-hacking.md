We're switching up the format this week: [Miranda Mulligan](https://twitter.com/jmm), Executive Director of the [Knight Lab](http://knightlab.northwestern.edu/), will be doing a 90-minute design thinking workshop. You'll learn how to figure out the right problem to solve when working on projects, and how to move from problem to prototype.
