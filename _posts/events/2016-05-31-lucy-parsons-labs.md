[Lucy Parsons Labs](https://lucyparsonslabs.com) is a new non-profit organization in Chicago that seeks to increase government transparency and accountability. They run a range of projects from [opening up government data through FOIA](https://www.muckrock.com/project/opening-the-chicago-surveillance-fund-25/) to [investigating police surveillance technology](https://redshiftzero.github.io/policesurveillance/).

[Jennifer Helsby](https://twitter.com/redshiftzero) ([previously at Chi Hack Night](https://chihacknight.org/events/2015/11/10/cryptoparty-digital-security-for-everyone.html)) and [Freddy Martinez](https://github.com/freddymartinez9) will discuss Lucy Parsons Labs and its mission as well as share their newest project: a deployment of [SecureDrop](https://lucyparsonslabs.com/securedrop), an anonymous whistleblowing submission platform. This system enables people who wish to reveal fraud, waste, illegality or abuse to leak documents to journalists securely without revealing their identity.
