### On the Table: What can civic technology do for Chicago?

For the Chicago Community Trustâ€™s [On the Table](https://onthetable.com/) event, Derek Eder and Robert Friedman will host a discussion as a Chi Hack Night breakout group. Anyone is welcome to join! We'll be covering the following questions:

* How can civic technology improve the political process, accountability and transparency? Is open data enough?
* How can data and technology be used to improve the lives of the most disadvantaged Chicagoans? Who are we building our civic apps with?
* How do we influence the creation of fair and ethical policies around the collection and protection of personal data?
