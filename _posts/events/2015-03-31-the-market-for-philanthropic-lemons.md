[Andrew Means](https://twitter.com/meansandrew), Co-Founder of [The Impact Lab](http://www.theimpactlab.co/) and organizer of next month's [Do Good Data conference](http://dogooddata.com/), will talk about how the social sector is like the market for used cars and how funders can avoid supporting 'lemons'. 

He'll draw upon examples from his work at The Impact Lab and as a mentor for the [Data Science for Social Good Summer Fellowship](http://dssg.io/).
