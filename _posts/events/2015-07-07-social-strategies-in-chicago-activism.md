How do Chicago activists generate buzz and media coverage with no budget? 

[Rachael Perrotta](https://twitter.com/plussone), [Media Relations Activist](http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/best-anti-establishment-mouthpiece/BestOf?oid=13795521), will give a look behind the scenes at the social media and public relations tools and strategies used by local groups like the [Trauma Care Coalition](http://twitter.com/TraumaCenterNow), fighting for level 1 trauma care on the South Side of Chicago since 2010. 

This presentation will track the group's progress — in just one month — from a coalition with no branding and little social media presence to a viral campaign targeting the University of Chicago that took over Twitter and made it into the pages of [The Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/08/obama-library-university-chicago-trauma-center-protests) and [The Nation](http://www.thenation.com/blog/209985/semester-ends-students-hold-sit-ins-win-higher-pay-and-unionize).
