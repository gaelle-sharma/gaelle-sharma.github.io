[Chicago's Municipal Election](http://www.chicagoelections.com/en/offices-on-the-ballots.html) will be held on **Feb 24, 2015**. Chicagoans will be voting for their next Mayor, City Clerk, City Treasurer and Alderman in each of Chicago's 50 Wards.

And you can bet there's a lot of data about each of these races.

For this election-themed hack night, [Jimm Dispensa](https://twitter.com/PezChicago) will talk about [Aldertrack](http://www.aldertrack.com/), a "quadrennial Chicago politics hobby vertical news service" he started in 2007.
 
Jimm will talk about how he helped turn a montage of open datasets and a love of municipal elections into a revenue-generating, [go-to information source](http://www.aldertrack.com/archives/) for Chicago political news junkies. 

**Bonus!** Check out the [Aldertrack Racing Form](/docs/01-28-2015_Aldertrack_Racing_Form.pdf) (PDF)
