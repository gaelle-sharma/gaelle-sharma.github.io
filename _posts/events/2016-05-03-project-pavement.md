This week, we'll be hearing from one of our very own breakout groups!

For the past year, the Personalized Bicycle Routing (PBR for short) breakout group has been working to help Chicagoans navigate their city by bicycle. 

[Zane Blanton](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zane-blanton-b7b62145) will demonstrate a prototype system that crowd-sources the measurement of pavement quality via smartphones mounted on bicycles. This is [Project Pavement](http://project-pavement.herokuapp.com/)! 

Zane will also discuss how these road quality data can be integrated with the [Open Source Routing Machine](http://project-osrm.org/) to provide more experience-oriented bicycle routing and talk about the future direction of the project from a policy, technology, and community standpoint.
