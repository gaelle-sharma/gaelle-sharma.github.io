For many Chicagoans, the political process of [City Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_City_Council) is shrouded in mystery. New policies seem to appear out of nowhere before they are quickly voted on by the council. This week, Chi Hack Night will get a rare view into what goes on behind the scenes.

[Adrienne Alexander](https://twitter.com/drixander), Policy & Legislative Specialist for the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) [Council 31](http://www.afscme31.org/#), will discuss her experience with the policy process in Chicago over the [past five years](http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/best-young-political-lobbyist/BestOf?oid=9868921).

Sheâ€™ll go over how outside organizations and lobbyists influence the process, present a few [examples of policy efforts](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/politics/ct-emanuel-afscme-311-privatization-letter-met-20151021-story.html), and a discuss the ways people can get involved on issues they care about.
