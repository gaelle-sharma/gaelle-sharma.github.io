No presentation this week. Instead, we're going to have another open hacking session!

Come build, share, and learn about civic tech!

**Note:** Due to a conflicting event, we will be meeting in the secondary atrium at Braintree to the left of the entrance.

#### Leadership Council #25

We will have our **25th** [Chi Hack Night Leadership Council](http://chihacknight.org/leadership-council.html) at **8pm** after the group breakouts get started. This meeting is for discussing new ideas and ways to make the hack night better. Anyone is welcome to join! 

If you'd like to bring up a topic, add it to the [Leadership Council agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LBksgZetvb9tlswuKgOqQ3feQe44xCCeb7uFv-wWRCg/edit).
