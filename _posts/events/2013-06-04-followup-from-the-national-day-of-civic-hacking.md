Some of you might be civic-hacked-out from this [weekend's](http://www.meetup.com/OpenGovChicago/events/119353342/) [events](http://civichack.adlerplanetarium.org/2014/), so we are going to keep things pretty light this week. If you want to share a story from the weekend (shoot us an email if you do), or continue a project you started, this is the time and place for it!
