Olatunji Oboi Reed from [Slow Roll Chicago](http://slowrollchicago.org/) will talk about his work in utilizing bicycles and community bike rides as tools of [neighborhood transformation](http://chi.streetsblog.org/2015/01/07/why-i-fight-how-biking-saved-my-life-and-can-benefit-other-black-chicagoans/#more-99814).

Oboi, along with transportation breakout group facilitator Steven Vance, will explore the use of data to tell the story of inequity in the City of Chicago's current approach to distributing bike infrastructure and lay out a vision to create an equitable, diverse bicycle culture for all Chicagoans.
