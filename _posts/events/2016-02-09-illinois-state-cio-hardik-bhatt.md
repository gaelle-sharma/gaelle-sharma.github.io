The State of Illinois is currently going through a major transformation. While technology plays a critical role in this change, the technology that government uses is undergoing a transformation of its own. 

While the State improves the business of information technology (IT), IT needs to continue improving business of the state. Data plays a key role in that, and though governments have done relatively well with open data, they have fared poorly as it comes to analyzing this data for decision-making. 

[Hardik Bhatt](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hardik-bhatt-a070344), [Chief Information Officer for the State of Illinois](http://www.illinois.gov/sites/cio/Pages/default.aspx), will talk about the technology changes the State of Illinois is undertaking, centered around building a data analytics practice with a three-fold focus:

* 360 degree customer views
* Predictive analytics
* External two-way data partnership 

Hardik looks to the Chi Hack Night to brainstorm ways government technology could be done better, faster and cheaper – with all constraints the State Government currently has.
