It's election night, and we're getting a special look into the data used by political campaigns while we watch the results come in.

The March 15th primary has an unusual number of [contested elections](http://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/hinsdale/news/ct-dhd-candidate-filing-tl-1203-20151130-story.html), with over a dozen in the Chicago area alone. Negative campaigning has figured heavily in most of them.

[Stanford/Caskey](http://www.oppresearch.com/) is an opposition research firm, specializing in producing the information that goes into these negative ads (and they're working in a lot of the races in Illinois).

[Will Caskey](https://www.linkedin.com/in/willcaskey), partner at Stanford/Caskey, will talk about the curious art and science of opposition research: how it's collected, how it's not, and how it's put to use by campaigns. He'll also discuss various examples of opposition research in the current election.
