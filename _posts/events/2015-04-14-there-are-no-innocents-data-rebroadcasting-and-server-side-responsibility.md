[Karl Fogel](http://www.red-bean.com/kfogel/) of [Open Tech Strategies, LLC](http://opentechstrategies.com/) will offer some examples of how merely republishing open data or publicly available information can lead to ethically uncomfortable situations, and offer some thoughts on a framework for handling such situations.  

Audience participation is encouraged! This is not a technical presentation, but rather discussion of an issue that anyone who collects and republishes data at a large scale is likely to face eventually.
