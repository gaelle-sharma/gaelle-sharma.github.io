We'll be hearing from one of our own [breakout groups](http://chihacknight.org/breakouts.html) this week: Modelling Pension Reform in Illinois!

[Ben Galewsky](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bengalewsky), [David Melton](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/david-melton/14/349/1b3), [Nathan Pinger](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathanpinger), [Denis Roarty](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/denis-roarty/30/b0/394) and [Tim Sharko](https://www.linkedin.com/in/timothysharko) will present their work to educate pensioners and taxpayers on all aspects of the state's pension crisis. 

Using online models they will unravel the complexities of pensions so we can understand how various reform proposals affect both taxpayers and state employees. Of particular interest is engagement of younger taxpayers and state workers who are most at risk in the current debate.
