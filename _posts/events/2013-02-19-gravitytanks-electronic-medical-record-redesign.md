I'm super excited to announce that [GravityTank](http://www.gravitytank.com/)'s [Amy Guterman](https://twitter.com/endlesscurls) and friends will be joining us for this Tuesday's hack night.

Amy and co. recently redesigned electronic medical records into a [useful and beautiful health tool](http://www.fastcodesign.com/1671709/the-white-house-reveals-a-redesigned-electronic-medical-record#1) for the White House's Health Design Challenge. They'll chat about the project, life, love, design, and everything in between. (And all in 20 minutes!)
