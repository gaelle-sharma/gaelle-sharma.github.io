Earlier this Fall [Aldertrack](http://aldertrack.com/) released the free [Clout.Wiki](http://clout.wiki/), a wiki of Chicago politicians, and The Quarterly Report, the first of a regularly updated directory of hundreds of Chicago city commission and board members. 

The two projects, built on years of past reporting, was assembled over a month-long team effort of data search and confirmation phone calls to city agencies. 

[Mike Fourcher](https://twitter.com/vouchey) and [Claudia Morell](https://twitter.com/claudiamorell) will describe how they did it, the challenges of getting reliable information and their plans and dreams for linking all that glorious information together.
