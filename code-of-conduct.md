## Code of Conduct

The Chi Hack Night community expects that their events:

1. Are a **safe** environment, where people are free to fully express their identities.
1. **Respect** the value of others and their ideas, skills and contributions. 
1. Assume everyone has different backgrounds where members **seek first to understand**, then to be understood. 
1. Recognize that **everyone has something to contribute** regardless of their technical abilities. 
1. **Default to open**: the data, the code, and the access. Members strive to build tools that are free for public use and incorporate open source software and open data. 
1. Are **a place for collaboration**, where members – experienced and new – work together to discuss issues and develop solutions, apps, and resources. 
1. Work to **engage all Chicagoans** and communities in planning, designing, and implementing open tech, especially those who are traditionally excluded from the civic process.
1. Ensure that the relationships and conversations among members of the Chi Hack Night, governments, and communities remain respectful, participatory, and **productive**.
1. Provide an environment where people are **free from discrimination or harassment** (if you are harassed or witness harassment refer to the harassment policy below).
1. **Are fun**.

### Anti-Harassment Policy

Chi Hack Night is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, nationality, age, or religion. 

We do not tolerate harassment of organizers, presenters, and participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any Chi Hack Night event, unless explicitly allowed by the organizers. Anyone in violation of these policies may expelled from Chi Hack Night events, at the discretion of the event organizers.

Harassment includes but is not limited to: offensive verbal or written comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, nationality, religion; sexual images in public spaces; deliberate intimidation; stalking; following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact; unwelcome sexual attention; unwarranted exclusion; and patronizing language or action.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the event organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from Chi Hack Night.
